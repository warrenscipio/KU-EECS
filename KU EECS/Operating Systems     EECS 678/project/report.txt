 
Introduction

The project requirements were to create a shell program that could do various tasks
that a shell would do, run executable files,redirect I/O, background and forgroud processes ect.


The program

we started with recieving the user input and carrying out the commands given by the user. Our parser function does most of this
it knows rather to run processes in the foreground or the background and deals with the PATH and HOME varibles
Our execute file deals with the IO redirecting. Throws errors based on if the command line can even be executed.
The list of tasks function literally lists the tasks and print them. The cd function is a pretty text book simple change HOME and display it in the prompt.


Difficulties... everything...
trying to write to the file we just created doesn't work, it seems like we search for the file before we create it and then the command line returns that it couldnt find the file even though it is made, and it just doesnt find the file at all if you try again
